# ClassAttendance
A simple Android app that is used for marking attendance of the students. This repository contains the android app code and the php web service code along with web Adminstration site. Every student is given a QR code which can be print from the Administration web site. When the student scans the qr code, the app responds with the appropriate toast message (whether the attendance was already marked for the day or if they have not yet been alloted any course)
